# mcl_back_to_spawn

A Mineclone2 mod which allows you to tp yourself to your spawn point, or someone else to his spawn point.

Enter `/back_to_spawn` in game chat to go back to your spawn point (or your bed if you set it up as your respawn point). If you have the `server` and `tp` privileges, you can type `/back_to_spawn <different player than you>` to teleport `<different player than you>` to his spawn point.
